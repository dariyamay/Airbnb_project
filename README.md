This project aims to analyze the data from the website airbnb.com. Airbnb is one of the biggest online platform that allows people to rent out their apartments/rooms/houses to people who are looking for accommodations.

This projects analyzes the data from 5 cities in the USA, namely New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston. The first three cities are the top 3 cities by populations, San Francisco takes 16th place and Boston - 21st (https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities).

The fist three cities were chosen so that to perform the statistical analysis, and find out is there a significant difference in the mean price of properties among them, and 2 other with singificantly less population, compare with the first three cities. Here the interest lies mainly on answering the questions like:
- what features influence the price of the properties: price vs number of guests, price vs number of rooms, price vs number of beds;
- is there is a significant difference in mean price per night of accommodation among cities?
- what are the main facility features?
